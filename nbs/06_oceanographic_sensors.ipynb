    "- Salinity and Temperature as a function of Depth are commonly measured by sensor probes called **CTD** (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth)\n",
    "- A CTD device’s primary function is to detect how the conductivity and temperature of the water column changes relative to depth.\n",

    "- Temperature: Thermometers\n",

    "They have a settling time, typically between 0.2-0.6 s.\n",
    "This must be taken into account when installed as a payload on a robot.\n",

    "Knowledge obtained from CTD devices can provide a more detailed understanding of the ocean water’s characteristic through the entire water column, which is crucial for understanding the physics involved. The physics in turn allow biologists to understand why the biology is present or not present at different depths and why the chemical makeup of the water changes over depth. The CTD is the key to understanding the physics, chemistry, and biology of the water column."
