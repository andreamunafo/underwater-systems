    "Long baseline navigation (LBL) is a method of determining the position of a underwater vehicle or diver using a series of acoustic transponders that are strategically placed on the ocean floor. The transponders emit a unique acoustic signal that can be detected by a transceiver on the underwater vehicle or diver. By measuring the time it takes for the signal to travel from the transponder to the transceiver, and knowing the speed of sound in water, the distance between the transponder and the transceiver can be calculated. By measuring the distance to multiple transponders, the position of the underwater vehicle or diver can be determined using trilateration. LBL is commonly used in oceanographic research, underwater exploration, and commercial diving operations."
