## How to use

You can open and run each notebook in any order your prefer depending on
your interest.

## Install

The notebooks run with python 3.10 and use the following python
libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

Notebook `00_Getting_started_with_Python_and_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb`
provides a short introduction on how to set up an anaconda environment
to get you started.

To use the notebooks you *might* need to install the feedback control
package. You can do this entering this into your terminal:

    pip install -e '.[dev]'

This is the recommended way to make a Python package importable from
anywhere in your current environment:

- `-e` – short for “editable”, lets you immediately use changes made to
  your package during development.
- `.` – refers to the current directory.
- `[dev]` – includes “development” requirements: other packages that
  your notebooks use solely for documentation or testing.
